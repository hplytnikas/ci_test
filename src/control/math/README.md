## Math for Control

Here we have all packages related to purely abstract mathematical operations that may be used in several parts of the planning and control pipeline.

# 1d Interpolant
This is an interpolator for functions from R to R, i.e. x --> f(x) where both x and f(x) are scalars.

# 2d Interpolant
This is an interpolator for curves in 2D space, i.e. s --> p(s) where s is a scalar progress and p(s) is a 2d-vector.

# Minimum Curvature Optimization
Here we solve the optimization problem that minimizes curvature given a 2d curve and maximum lateral deviations from that path. Is used for planning.
