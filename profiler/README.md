# Profiler
This directory will be used to store all .prof files generated by the **Easy Profiler** library.
All files must start with the package name followed by the date and time in *YYYY_MM_DD-hh_mm* format, where the time is the time that the node was launched.
*E.g. `slam_2024_04_04-13_10.prof`*
